# JS Excercise: jQuery Overlay/Popup

#### This is a JS script that can be pasted into the JS console in the browser.

From the [Marmot shop](https://www.marmot.com/) home page, the script grabs data from the customer cart and displays select data (number of items, item thumbnails, cart total) in a popup window, which is triggered when the user scrolls down to the bottom 10% of the page.

## TODOs:

1. Debug scroll method so that script can be reactivated after popup window closed

2. Add conditionals for empty cart

3. Add media queries for mobile/carts with > 3 items (change flex-direction? CSS grid?)

4. Set default image if broken link/image missing

5. Test browser compatibility (developed in Crome)
